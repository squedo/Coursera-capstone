INTRODUCTION:

Unfortunately, car accidents happen.

Would it be possible to understand/predict the severity of an eventual accident if ever happening?

We will be exploring the feasibility of creating such a predictive model based on variables that could be stored into the following catergories:

  - Driver data (age, etc.)
  - Time, road and environmental conditions (visibility, weather conditions, moment of the year, etc.)
  - Car specifications (Engine capacity, driver side, etc)
  - Parameters of the accident (speed, point of impact, etc.)

To proceed we will be using the database published on Kaggle.com called "UK Accidents 10 years history with many variables" that collects accidents that took place from 2005-2014 in UK roads. Data are stored in 3 tables: accidents, vehicles and casualties and can be found in the following link:

NOTE: this database is likely to give insights / prediction model to be used only for countries like UK, Japan, Australia, India (more that 50 countries) where traffic happens from left side.
